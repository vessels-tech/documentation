Settlement
models can be defined by scheme administrators, and have the following
characteristics:</p> <ol><li><p>They can support settlement either gross or net settlements. If gross, then
a settlement is executed after each transfer is completed. If net, a group
of transfers is settled together.</p></li> <li><p>They can support either multilateral or bilateral settlements. If
settlements are multilateral, each participant settles with the scheme for
the net of its transfers which are included in the settlement. If they are
multilateral, each participant settles separately with each of the other
participants and the scheme is not a party to the settlement.</p></li> <li><p>They can support either deferred or immediate settlements. If settlements
are immediate, they are actioned immediately they are completed. If they are
deferred, they are actioned after a period of delay.</p></li> <li><p>They can support continuous or discontinuous settlements. Discontinuous
settlements require a formal approval from a resource outside the system to
confirm that they have been completed. Continuous settlements can be
approved from within the switch, provided that the criteria for approval are
met.</p></li> <li><p>They can require liquidity support or not.</p></li></ol> <h2 id="ledger-account-type"><a href="#ledger-account-type" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ledger account type</h2> <p>A ledger account type defines a type of internal account.

Settlement Accounts held at the Settlement Bank</p></li> <li><p>HUB_RECONCILIATION. Each implementation of the switch has one account of
this type for each currency supported by the switch, owned by the virtual
DFSP which represents the Hub in the implementation. The account is used
during FUNDS IN/OUT operations to represent movements in participants’
SETTLEMENT accounts.</p></li> <li><p>HUB_MULTILATERAL_SETTLEMENT. Each implementation of the switch has one
account of this type for each currency supported by the switch, owned by the
virtual DFSP which represents the Hub in the implementation. This account
type is used to record counterparty information for net amounts paid to or
from participants as part of settlements. Entries in this account represent
balancing values corresponding with the net value in a participant’s
POSITION account for a given settlement.</p></li> <li><p>HUB_FEE. Accounts of this type represent accounts into which fees are
collected, or from which they are disbursed. (Not implemented)</p></li></ol> <h2 id="ledger-entry-type"><a href="#ledger-entry-type" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ledger entry type</h2> <p>A ledger entry type categorises the type of funds which are the content of a

transfer. The current values are:</p> <ol><li><p>PRINCIPLE_VALUE. This designates the funds moved as the content of a

the scheme. It may be either the creditor or the debtor in a transaction. It
is used during the settlement process. This is used for entries whose
counterparty is an entry in the HUB account.</p></li></ol> <h2 id="settlement-states"><a href="#settlement-states" class="header-anchor">#</a> Settlement states</h2> <p>A settlement may be in a number of possible states. The states currently
supported are:</p> <ol><li><p>PENDING_SETTLEMENT. A new settlement consisting of one or more settlement
windows has been created. The net amounts due to or from each participant
have been calculated and a report detailing these net amounts has been
produced.</p></li> <li><p>PS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED: all the calculated net amounts for the settlement
have been converted into transfers between the creditor and debtor accounts.
It is applied for each settlement entry and at settlement level, when all
entries are recorded. This state is not applied to settlement windows.</p></li> <li><p>PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED: all the funds required for settlement have been
reserved (debit amounts only.) It is applied for each settlement entry and
at settlement level, when all entries are reserved.</p></li> <li><p>PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED: all the credit amounts required as part of the
settlement have been committed. It is applied for each settlement entry and
at settlement level, when all entries are committed.</p></li> <li><p>SETTLING: It is used only at settlement level if all accounts are not yet
settled.</p></li> <li><p>SETTLED: This state is applied to settlement accounts in
PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED state. When applied to even one account, the
settlement will transit to SETTLING state. When all accounts in a window are
SETTLED, the settlement window will change from PENDING_SETTLEMENT to
SETTLED, while the settlement is still in SETTLING state. When all accounts
from all windows are SETTLED, the settlement will be changed to SETTLED. It
is possible for a settlement to change directly from PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED
to SETTLED if all accounts are settled with one request.</p></li> <li><p>ABORTED: the settlement could not be completed and should be rolled back. It
is currently only possible to abort a settlement if the state is one of:
PENDING_SETTLEMENT, PS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED or PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED. After
having even one account in PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED state (even if the
settlement as a whole is still in PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED), a request to abort
the settlement is rejected. It should be noted that this prevents abortion
in cases such as the default of a participant midway through the settlement
process.</p></li></ol> <p>The present data model contains a foreign key to the enumeration table
containing settlement states from the

be applied to the individual elements of a settlement. As a consequence, the
descriptions should be taken to refer to individual settlement amounts as well
as to the settlement as a whole.</p> <h2 id="settlement-window-states"><a href="#settlement-window-states" class="header-anchor">#</a> Settlement window states</h2> <p>A settlement is made up of one or more settlement windows. Each settlement
window has a state associated with it. The current values of this table are as

added to it. It is available for settlement.</p></li> <li><p>PENDING_SETTLEMENT: the settlement window’s contents have been included in a
settlement request, but this request is a request for deferred settlement
which has not yet been completed.</p></li> <li><p>SETTLED: the scheme has confirmed that the obligations incurred by
participants as a consequence of the settlement to which this settlement
window belongs have been met by those participants and the settlement is
therefore complete.</p></li> <li><p>ABORTED: the settlement to which this settlement window belongs did not
complete. The settlement window is available to be included in another
settlement.</p></li></ol> <h2 id="transfer-states"><a href="#transfer-states" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transfer states</h2> <p>Each transaction which passes through the system can be assigned one of a fixed
number of states. The current values of this state are:</p> <ol><li><p>RECEIVED_PREPARE: the switch has received the transaction request.</p></li> <li><p>RESERVED: the switch has reserved the funds required to cover the
transaction.</p></li> <li><p>RECEIVED_FULFIL: the switch has received the fulfilment request, and the
transaction has been assigned to a settlement window</p></li> <li><p>COMMITTED: the transaction has been committed.</p></li> <li><p>FAILED: the transaction has failed in some unspecified way and has been
aborted. (Not implemented)</p></li> <li><p>RESERVED_TIMEOUT: the transaction has timed out while in the reserved state

the switch; others are internally generated by the switch (e.g. to record net
movements of funds associated with settlements.)</p> <p>It may be a source of confusion that, although “transfers” is a term used e.g.
in the Interoperability API specification to designate the movement of funds

scheme making a <strong>POST</strong> to the <strong>/settlements</strong> resource in the settlement API.
The caller gives a reason for the settlement request. This is a synchronous
call, whose return is described in Section 4.1.5 below. Internally, the
initiation is marked by the creation of a record in the <strong>settlement</strong> table and
the association of a number of settlement window records in the
<strong>settlementWindow</strong> table with the settlement created. This says: I want this
settlement to contain these settlement windows. Each of the settlement windows
selected to form part of this settlement must have the status CLOSED or ABORTED.
When selected to form part of a settlement, the status of each window should be
changed to PENDING_SETTLEMENT. The status of the settlement itself should also
be set to PENDING_SETTLEMENT.</p> <h3 id="calculating-the-content-of-a-settlement"><a href="#calculating-the-content-of-a-settlement" class="header-anchor">#</a> Calculating the content of a settlement</h3> <p>When a settlement has been requested and the windows which it will contain have

PENDING_SETTLEMENT. Each of these records will have the account type SETTLEMENT.
The ledger entry type will be SETTLEMENT_NET_SENDER, SETTLEMENT_NET_RECIPIENT or
SETTLEMENT_NET_ZERO depending on whether the participant owes money to the
scheme, is owed money by the scheme or is neutral in the settlement,
respectively. The transfer participant type is HUB for the Hub participant and
DFSP_POSITION for the DFSP participant. The account type is imposed by the
participant currency – for the Hub participant it is the
HUB_MULTILATERAL_SETTLEMENT and for the DFSP participant it is the POSITION

from participants in a settlement, the scheme can update the switch with this
information by issuing a <strong>PUT</strong> to the <strong>/updateSettlementById</strong> resource of
the settlement API and setting the <strong>state</strong> value of the content of the message
to ABORTED. A <strong>PUT</strong> call on the <strong>/updateSettlementById</strong> resource is the only
method which may be used for ABORTING a settlement. If any account information
is given in the call, then neither the <strong>state</strong> nor the <strong>reason</strong> nor the
<strong>externalReference</strong> fields may be set. if the <strong>state</strong> value is set at the
top level of the call, then the <strong>reason</strong> field must also be set, and the
request will be rejected if any account information is given in the call.</p> <p>If an attempt is made to abort a settlement, and any of the accounts in the
settlement have the status PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED or SETTLED, then the request
will be rejected.</p> <p>When a call is received, a new record is created in the
<strong>settlementParticipantCurrencyStateChange</strong> table, and is given the appropriate
status based on the status reported by the caller. Depending on the update that
was received, this may also require the status of the transaction and that of
the participant position to be updated. No, it is done at settlement level for
the entire settlement and all entries in settlementParticipantCurrency are
affected.</p> <p>Note: if the settlement is bilateral, then there is no obvious reason to abort
the entire settlement if one interchange fails. We should think about this use
case and how we would want to represent it. This document does not consider this
use case.</p> <p>Aborting a settlement comprises the following steps:</p> <ol><li><p>The status of the transfers created in Section 5.1.6 above should be changed
to ABORTED.</p></li> <li><p>A new record is added to the <strong>settlementParticipantCurrencyStateChange</strong>
table for each of the participant records in the settlement. This record has
a status of ABORTED, and the <strong>currentStateChangeId</strong> column in the
<strong>settlementParticipantCurrency</strong> table for that participant record is
changed to point to this new record.</p></li> <li><p>A new record is added to the <strong>settlementWindowStateChange</strong> table for each
settlement window in the settlement. This record has a status of ABORTED,
and the <strong>currentStateChangeId</strong> column in the settlementWindow table for
that window is changed to point to this new record.</p></li> <li><p>A new record is added to the <strong>settlementStateChange</strong> table for the
settlement. This record has a status of ABORTED, and the
<strong>currentStateChangeId</strong> column in the <strong>settlement</strong> table is changed to
point to this new record.</p></li> <li><p>If positions have been reserved for net creditors as a result of the
settlement (see Section 5.1.7.3 above,) then a balancing entry will be
created in the <strong>participantPositionChange</strong> table to reverse the
reservation of funds. This action does not at present reverse any change to
the account’s Net Debit Cap that may have been made as a consequence of this
reservation.</p></li> <li><p>Any records created in the <strong>transfers</strong> table (see Section 5.1.7.2 above)
will have their state changed in two steps by adding records to the
<strong>transferStateChange</strong> table. The first step will change the transfer state
to REJECTED. The second step will change the state to ABORTED.</p></li></ol> <p>Question: should there be/is there a time-out after which a settlement will be
aborted if it has not completed? If there is, how is it set? No, there isn’t
timeout on a settlement level. But when transfers are prepared (for
PS_TRANSFERS_RECORED) expiration is set on a transfer level. Its value is
controlled by a Config.TRANSFER_VALIDITY_SECONDS, which currently defaults to
432000 seconds, which equals 5 days. It is big enough to avoid expiration.
Still, if that happens, it would leave the data in an unrecoverable by the API
state. This is very good point and should be certainly addressed with the next
increment!</p> <h2 id="recording-the-deposit-of-funds"><a href="#recording-the-deposit-of-funds" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recording the deposit of funds</h2> <p>As participants are informed of their liabilities under the settlement, it is

settled as soon as it is fulfilled. The following changes are required to
implement this change.</p> <h3 id="database-changes-2"><a href="#database-changes-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Database changes</h3> <p>The database changes shown in Section 8 below should be implemented. These can
be summarised as follows:</p> <h4 id="changes-to-support-the-settlement-model"><a href="#changes-to-support-the-settlement-model" class="header-anchor">#</a> Changes to support the settlement model</h4> <p>A number of new tables are required to define a settlement model and to store
the enumerations for its definition types. This comprises the following tables
in the ERD:</p> <ul><li><p>settlementDelay</p></li> <li><p>settlementInterchange</p></li> <li><p>settlementModel</p></li></ul> <p>In addition, the <strong>settlementmodel</strong> table has foreign keys to two existing
tables, as follows:</p> <ol><li><p>A foreign key to the <strong>currency</strong> table to enable the settlement model to
settle only scheme accounts in a particular currency. If this entry is
blank, this should be interpreted as saying that the settlement model
settles all currencies that are not specified as being settled by other
settlement models for the same account type.</p></li> <li><p>A foreign key to the <strong>ledgerAccountType</strong> table. This specifies that the
settlement model settles accounts of this type.</p></li></ol> <h4 id="changes-to-the-ledgeraccounttype-table"><a href="#changes-to-the-ledgeraccounttype-table" class="header-anchor">#</a> Changes to the <strong>ledgeraccounttype</strong> table</h4> <p>The current <strong>ledgeraccounttype</strong> table stores a number of entries for account
types which should not be used for settlements – for instance,
HUB_MULTILATERAL_SETTLEMENT. A column should therefore be added to the
<strong>ledgeraccounttype</strong> table to indicate whether the account type can be attached
to a settlement model or not. This column is called <strong>settleable</strong>, and is
specified as a Boolean value, NOT NULL and with a default of FALSE.</p> <p>Of the existing ledger account types, PRINCIPAL_VALUE, INTERCHANGE_FEE and
HUB_FEE should be marked as capable of being attached to settlement models (this
value should be TRUE.) For all other ledger account types, the column should be
set to FALSE. If new ledger account types are added to this table via the
eventual settlement API, then they should have a value of TRUE.</p> <h4 id="changes-to-the-ledgerentrytype-table"><a href="#changes-to-the-ledgerentrytype-table" class="header-anchor">#</a> Changes to the <strong>ledgerentrytype</strong> table</h4> <p>Implementation of the TIPS settlement model requires an explicit association
between ledger entry types and the account types in which they should appear.
Since each ledger entry type should only appear in a single account type, though
multiple ledger entry types may appear in a given account type, this is modelled
by including a foreign key reference to the <strong>ledgeraccounttype</strong> table as a
column in the <strong>ledgerentrytype</strong> table. It should be noted that this applies
only to ledger entry types which are associated with a settlement model, as
described in Section 6.2.1.2 above. The assignment of existing entries in the
database would be as follows:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Ledger Entry Type</th> <th>Ledger Account Type</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>PRINCIPAL_VALUE</td> <td>POSITION</td></tr> <tr><td>INTERCHANGE_FEE</td> <td>INTERCHANGE_FEE</td></tr> <tr><td>HUB_FEE</td> <td>HUB_FEE</td></tr> <tr><td></td> <td></td></tr></tbody></table> <h4 id="changes-to-the-settlement-table"><a href="#changes-to-the-settlement-table" class="header-anchor">#</a> Changes to the <strong>settlement</strong> table</h4> <p>The <strong>settlement</strong> table should have a column added to it to allow the
settlement model to be used in settling it to be specified. The column should be
called <em>settlementModelId</em>. It should have the same data type as the equivalent
field in the <strong>settlementModel</strong> table, and should be a foreign key into that
table. It should be defined as not null.</p> <h4 id="changes-to-the-settlementwindow-table"><a href="#changes-to-the-settlementwindow-table" class="header-anchor">#</a> Changes to the <strong>settlementWindow</strong> table</h4> <p>As well as settlements, individual settlement windows will need to be assigned
to settlement models. The <strong>settlementWindow</strong> table should therefore have a
column added to it to allow the settlement model to be used in settling it to be
specified. The column should be called <em>settlementModelId</em>. It should have the
same data type as the equivalent field in the <strong>settlementModel</strong> table, and
should be a foreign key into that table. It should be defined as not null.</p> <p>This concludes the list of schema changes required to support the TIPS
settlement models</p> <h3 id="api-changes"><a href="#api-changes" class="header-anchor">#</a> API changes</h3> <p>API Support for the settlement functionality required for TIPS will include the

when the instance is set up, and subsequent settlement windows are created by
closing the current settlement window. In the new settlement management
structure, we will need the ability to create new settlement windows where no
predecessors exist: for instance, when an administrator decides to settle a

specified in the <em>ledgeraccounttypeid</em> column of the row in the
<strong>ledgerentrytype</strong> table appropriate to the ledger entry type which is being
created.</p> <p>For example: if a normal entry representing a transfer is being created, it will
have a ledger entry type of PRINCIPAL_VALUE. It should be assigned to the
POSITION account type (the default position at present.) This implies that the
match described in Section 6.2.1.3 above has been implemented.</p> <p>Question: how does the switch decide whether or when to construct a record in
the <strong>participantPositionChange</strong> table? How would it be possible to select the
ledger account type to which the position refers?</p> <h2 id="processing-interchange-fees"><a href="#processing-interchange-fees" class="header-anchor">#</a> Processing interchange fees</h2> <p>In order to support the scheme model implemented by TIPS, we need to generate
and settle liabilities incurred as a consequence of making transfers between
particular types of customer. The general form of this rule is as follows:</p> <ul><li><p>If the transaction is a wallet-to-wallet P2P transaction, then the receiver
DFSP pays the sender DFSP 0.6% of the amount of the transaction.</p></li> <li><p>No interchange fees are levied for on-us transactions.</p></li></ul> <p>The business decisions around this requirement are:</p> <ol><li><p>The definition of whether or not a payee account is a wallet will be
returned by the payee DFSP as part of customer discovery. The mechanism by
which this is implemented is outside the scope of this document.</p></li> <li><p>Interchange fees will be captured by the switch when the transfers which
incur them are completed.</p></li> <li><p>Interchange fees will have the ledger entry type INTERCHANGE_FEE and will be
recorded in accounts whose type is INTERCHANGE_FEE.</p></li> <li><p>Interchange fees will be settled multilaterally, net and deferred. It is
expected that this settlement will take place monthly.</p></li> <li><p>Interchange fees do not require liability cover by participants.</p></li></ol> <p>This functionality will be implemented as a partial instance of a general
process for defining and executing rules, and for taking actions based on the
outcome of evaluation of a rule. For this particular case, we propose the
changes described in the following sections.</p> <h3 id="part-1-run-script-for-batch-update-of-interchange-fees-when-settlement-window-is-closed"><a href="#part-1-run-script-for-batch-update-of-interchange-fees-when-settlement-window-is-closed" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 1: Run script for batch update of interchange fees when settlement window is closed.</h3> <p>Include stories to manage account type definition</p> <h3 id="part-2-add-reservation-on-prepare-using-script-and-modify-fulfilment-to-fulfil-all-ledger-types-for-which-an-entry-has-been-made"><a href="#part-2-add-reservation-on-prepare-using-script-and-modify-fulfilment-to-fulfil-all-ledger-types-for-which-an-entry-has-been-made" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 2: Add reservation on prepare using script and modify fulfilment to fulfil all ledger types for which an entry has been made</h3> <h3 id="evaluating-a-rule"><a href="#evaluating-a-rule" class="header-anchor">#</a> Evaluating a rule</h3> <p>The process of evaluating a rule is based on the following assumptions:</p> <ol><li><p>There will be a standard form of rule evaluation with the following
structure:</p> <ol><li><p>A transaction object will be passed as the parameter to the rule
evaluation function.</p></li> <li><p>The rule evaluation itself will use a complex if statement.</p></li> <li><p>If the rule evaluates to TRUE, then an action should be executed as
described in Section 6.3.2 below.</p></li></ol></li></ol> <p>An example of a rule function to evaluate a TIPS interchange fee rule could be:</p> <p>function evaluateInterchangeFee (transaction) {</p> <p>if(</p> <p>(transaction.payee.fspId.toLowerCase() != transaction.payer.fspId.toLowerCase())</p> <p>&amp;&amp; (transaction.extensionList[“payerAccountType”].toLowerCase() ==

appropriate action should be taken. In the case of the immediate example of
interchange fees, the action taken should be to add two entries to the
participants’ interchange fee accounts, on recording the debit from the payee of
the interchange fee amount and the other recording the credit to the payer of
the interchange fee amount.</p> <p>A simple yet general way of supporting actions of this type is to define a class
(which might be called ruleAction) and adding methods to it to represent the
actions to be taken. The rule evaluation function can then instantiate the class
and call the appropriate function.</p> <p>In the case of the interchange fees, we would define an action called
addLedgerEntry, with the following parameters:</p> <ol><li><p>The transfer ID for which the ledger entry is being created</p></li> <li><p>The ledger entry type to be used</p></li> <li><p>The currency in which the amount is denominated</p></li> <li><p>The amount of the fee</p></li> <li><p>The FSP ID of the credit party</p></li> <li><p>The FSP ID of the debit party</p></li></ol> <p>This might appear in the rule evaluation function as:</p> <p>myAction.addLedgerEntry(transaction.transactionId,</p> <p>transaction.transactionId,</p> <p>&quot;INTERCHANGE_FEE“,</p> <p>transaction.currency,</p> <p>transaction.amount*0.006,</p> <p>transaction.payer.fspId,</p> <p>transaction.payee.fspId);</p> <h3 id="providing-a-generic-framework-for-rule-evaluation"><a href="#providing-a-generic-framework-for-rule-evaluation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Providing a generic framework for rule evaluation</h3> <p>Finally, we will need to provide a generic framework to trigger the evaluation
